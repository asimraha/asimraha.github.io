## COMPUTER AIDED ENGINEERING (CAE)
Usage of computer software to aid in engineering analysis including process
simulation, optimization, design analysis, proposal work etc. to achieve economic
solution with time saving &amp; quality improvements. The solution tools are offered in user
friendly platforms at very competitive rates.

## SNAPSHOT  
- Optimum production & yield
- Setup process parameters 
- Mill Setup & Pass Shedule
- Complicated calculations using Mathematical Model & set of Algorithms 
- Utility tools for Engineering / Production offices
- Proposal work for Engineering offices with value addition in Rolling Mills & Processing Lines. 

## BENEFITS
- Simulating reality amounts to savings in time and money
- Reduces errors in Engineering & Process
- The impact of changing parameters on a system can be studied with more accuracy
- Allows easy visualization of Process or Designs
